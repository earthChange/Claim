# Intro
**Claim** is a token and business model to build and maintain user-owned supply-chains.

# Token
- **Claim** - Any square meter (M²) of land.
  - Total supply is the total number of M² of land on Earth.
  - Circulating supply is the number of M² under these Terms.

# Model
- **Coupon** - A request to produce a specific good or service.  Each **Coupon** requires **Contracts** and **Deeds**.
- **Contract** - A commitment to produce a specific **Coupon** in return for some *arbitrarily negotiated* amount of **Claim**.
- **Deed** - A title of land ownership at a specific location held under these Terms.

# Terms
- You may select or create any kind of **Coupon**.
- You earn **Claim** tokens incrementally as your **Contract** is fullfilled.
- You earn **Deeds** as {the **Coupons** you helped produce} are finally fulfilled, or after some *arbitrarily negotiated* timeout.
